:: # Batch file to run Work Location Choice Calibration
:: # nagednra.dhakar@rsginc.com, May 2017

:: # Setup:
:: # Three directories: 
:: # 	daysim - all daysim inputs and coefficients with "output" and "working" folders. This batchfile should be in this folder.
:: # 	daysim_summaries - R scripts and output folder
:: # 	iterations - "WorkLocation_CR0" folder with the daysim coefficient file and shadow prices (including park and ride shadow prices)

:: # Process:
:: # User need to update "iteration_no" for every calibration round
:: # Always start with iteration=0 by running your base DaySim run - for this you need to have "WorkLocation_CR0" in the "iterations" folder with the daysim coefficent file and shadow prices (including park and ride shadow prices)

:: # Example:
:: # for illustration purpose, let's say iteration_no=1
:: # 1. copies two coefficient files from "WorkLocation_CR1" under the folder "iterations" to DaySim folder
:: # 2. Runs DaySim
:: # 3. Runs DaySim summaries
:: # 4. Copies "WrkLocation.xlsm" from summaries output folder to "WorkLocation_CR1" under the folder "iterations" as "WrkLocation_CR1.xlsm".
:: # 5. Creates a new directory "WorkLocation_CR2" for the next iteration (iteration=2) under "iterations"
:: # 6. Copies two shadow prices and the coefficients file from current iteration folder (WorkLocation_CR1) to the next iteration folder (WorkLocation_CR2) created in the last step
:: # 7. Copies shadow prices from current iteration folder (WorkLocation_CR1) to DaySim Folder

:: # USER NEEDS TO PERFORM THESE BEFORE RUNNING THE BATCH FILE FOR THE NEXT ITERATION
:: # 1. First, update coefficients in the tab "WorkLocationCoefficients" under "WrkLocation_CR1.xlsm" with the coefficient file in folder "WorkLocation_CR1"
:: #    this step would update the coefficients in the spreadsheet "WrkLocation_CR1.xlsm"
:: # 2. Now, update coefficient file under the next iteration folder "WorkLocation_CR2" with the new coefficients from "calibration" tab in spreadsheet "WrkLocation_CR1.xlsm"
:: # 3. Update Iteration_no = 2 in this batch file
:: # 4. Run the batch file
